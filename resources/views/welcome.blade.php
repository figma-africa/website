                        Figma Africa is a community of web designers and other creatives. 
                        Although we are not the only design community out there but we are fast 
                        becoming the go-to place for designers in Africa, and hopefully 
                        you will also be a part of it too.

                        Obviously, people need to hear about design first before being 
                        interested and we are always open to ideas and suggestions on how to 
                        make this work so talk to us. If you have a different conversation in mind 
                        or question, still reach out to us.
