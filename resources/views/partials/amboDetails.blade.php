    <h3>To scale our community globally, we think its best to focus on empowering the Figma advocates and experts 
    who already exist to grow, create, and bring more people into the design community</h3>
    <p>The goal has always been to make design accessible -- to anyone, anywhere in the world. So far that has been done that by making the Figma tool work on any device and stay intuitively easy to learn.</p>
    <p>Now that the tool has been put in place, we are shifting our focus to making design education more accessible to people, this means the more we are able to build 
        and grow community, the more everyone involved in the community can level up - or become a better designer.</p>
    <p>At Figma we believe in making design accessible. We also believe in the power of community. Our goal with the ambassador program 
        is to empower passionate Figma users to build their own design communities. With our ambassadors, we are able to do just which is providing support, encouragement
        and resources need build design growth within communities.</p>
